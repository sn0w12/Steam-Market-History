# Steam-Market-History
Make Steam market history readable by excel/ sheets

Code is a little (a lot) shitty but it doesn't really matter it does the job. Supports different languages through typing in what you want the months to be called, swedish is default since i am from Sweden, you can save your own months if you write them in for later use. You can get the market history of any item by pasting its market listing in one of the text boxes. You can choose between dollars and euros, could probably add your own if you wanted to but you would have to find what number it is.
